# 3DRenderViewer.
This is the report2 Code of my Java2D3D final project.
To build a 3D object viewer, I refered to this tutorial : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQedlivHAPc&list=PLgRPwj3No0VLXFoqYnL2aYhczXB2qwKvp

## What does this viewer do.
The viewer allows the usual rendering modes:
* Points
* Wireframe
* Flat/smooth shading
* Wireframe sur-imposed on filled polygons

## To run the project, you have to modify:
1. The directory of input file, where is at "3Drender\renderer\Display.java", line 64.
2. The mode of the output result, where is at "3Drender\renderer\Display.java", line 135-137.
